## Repository Contents

### 1. Simulated Antenna Design  
**File name:** `Antenna`  
**Description:** This file provides the complete simulated design of the antenna along with its simulation results.  
**Requirements:** The file is intended to be opened and simulated using **Ansys HFSS**.

---

### 2. Simulated S-Parameter  
**File name:** `Antenna_sim.s1p`  
**Description:** Contains the simulated S11 parameter of the designed antenna.  
**How to use:** This file can be opened with various RF tools. For basic inspection, a text editor such as **Notepad** can also be used.

---

### 3. Measured S-Parameter with VNA  
**File name:** `Antenna_meas.s1p`  
**Description:** Contains the measured S11 parameter of the fabricated antenna using a **Vector Network Analyzer (VNA)**.  
**How to use:** Like the simulated file, it can be read by various RF tools or simply viewed using a **text editor**.

---

### 4. S-Parameter Comparison  
**File name:** `meas_and_sim.m`  
**Description:** MATLAB script used to compare the measured and simulated S11 parameters of the antenna.  
**Requirements:** Requires **MATLAB** with the **RF Toolbox** installed to run the script and generate comparison plots.
